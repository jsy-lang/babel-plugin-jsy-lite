# babel-plugin-jsy-lite
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jsy-lang/babel-plugin-jsy-lite.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jsy-lang/babel-plugin-jsy-lite)

JSY is an indented (offside) JavaScript dialect. We believe indentation is better at describing code blocks.

This is the newer [`jsy-transpile`][] based implementation for the Babel ecosystem,
replacing the older [`babel-plugin-offside-js`][] that injected and extended the Babylon parser using private APIs.

Please see [JSY language docs](https://github.com/jsy-lang/jsy-lang-docs) for details on the JSY dialect.
